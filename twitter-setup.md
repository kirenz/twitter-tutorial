*Please note: The keys in the screenshot above are hidden, but in your own developer portal, you will be able to see the actual values for the API Key, API Secret Key and Bearer Token.*

Click the (+) next to *API Key*, *API Secret Key* and *Bearer Token* and copy it in a safe place on your local machine. You will need them in on of the following steps.

### Step 6: Get access token and access token secret

Obtain the *access token* and *access token secret*: These can be generated in your [developer portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/projects-and-apps), under the `“Keys and tokens”` tab for your developer App.

Add them to the file with your *API Key*, *API Secret Key* and *Bearer Token*.
